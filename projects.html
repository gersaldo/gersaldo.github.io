                            This is the first project I was assigned to 
                            as a research assitant. The task at hand was to be able to create renderings
                            of molecular orbitals from calculations generated by the Chronus Quantum (CQ)
                            software package. CQ is a computational chemistry package capable of 
                            creating simulations for quantum interactions, and an aspect of the package
                            that was missing was visualization for that data, especially visualization of 
                            molecular orbitals, which is important and useful information for the chemistry 
                            community. Thus, I created a method that extracted data from calculations, and 
                            reformatted the data into files readable by many well-known scientific visualization packages.
                            With this method, I was able to generate molecular orbital graphs, (pictured to the left)
                            The source code is currently private, as it is being developed concurrently with CQ,
                            but please inquire if you are interested in learning more about the algorithms I applied
                            for an efficient data transfer.

                            This project was also done for CQ, and it has a similar
                            goal as the MO Visualizer, to create visualizations of quantum
                            interactions, but this time, it can generate videos that show
                            the electron density difference within a chemical system through time.
                            As this project requires different softwares to work harmonically, 
                            I implemented user interface features to make the workflow process
                            more cohesive, and to make the process of creating movies much simpler. To the right,
                            is a frame from one of the videos generated by my project from a calculation in CQ. 
                            Like my other project,
                            the source code is also still private, so please
                            inquire if any questions arise.
