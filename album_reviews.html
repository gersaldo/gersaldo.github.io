                                Sweetener was the first album in her second era (Sweetener,
                                Thank u Next, and Positions) and it was a great experience 
                                for me. This album is what rebranded herself from her modern 
                                pop era to her R&B flavor she is now known for. Personally, 
                                I loved this album. There were a few parts of the album that 
                                made it less cohesive, like having No Tears Left to Cry and 
                                Successful very close to each other in the lineup. The cohesion
                                makes it a bit harder to listen to because of the different, hard to 
                                follow, vibes. Even though not very cohesive, there are some of my 
                                favorite songs Grande has ever put out. This album was produced with the 
                                help of Pharell, and this is one of my favorite projects he has worked on.
                                Overall, a good/great album. 7.5/10

                                Ctrl has been an all-time favorite for me. This album tells a 
                                story of trust in others, self discovery, reflection on past 
                                experiences, and hope for a better future. The production of 
                                this album is very good, and adding in artists like Kendrick 
                                Lamar and James Fauntleroy as support just creates a more 
                                diverse sound. This album has great cohesion, with every song 
                                and transition feeling just right, as if each song was 
                                carefully made and placed. If I could make any changes to 
                                this album, I probably wouldn't out of fear of lessening 
                                this masterpiece. This is a beautiful, no skip album, and 
                                it is a regular listen for me. Near perfect, 9.5/10

                                An album which showcases many aspects of love. This album is 
                                Tyler, the Creator's fifth studio album, which he produced 
                                himself with the help of others. This is personally my 
                                favorite album from Tyler because of the sound and storytelling
                                . This album also features many other great artists like Solange Knowles, who both are great additions to this album. 
                                Personal favorites are A BOY IS A GUN, I THINK, and NEW MAGIC 
                                WAND. These electrifying tracks all have great storytelling, 
                                great production, and somehow all fit really well in this album. 
                                I think the key to an album that flows well is making sure songs 
                                complement each other, which these all do very well. Again, this 
                                is another album I would not change, and I recommend everyone to 
                                listen to it. Perfect, 10/10.

                                El Mal Querer is Rosalia's second studio album, and she 
                                delivered a great performance. This album shows her transition 
                                from a traditional flamenco singer to having a greater range. 
                                This is a mix of flamenco with heavy influences from Caribbean, 
                                Latin American, and African American music. This is personally 
                                my favorite album from Rosalia, and this was an era where her 
                                music depended on her voice greatly. Which, I believe is a good 
                                thing because her voice is strong and always is the centerpiece 
                                of her songs. This album is very cohesive, talking about love 
                                and losses, among other themes. This is a very passionate album, 
                                and I recommend anyone to listen to it. Great album, 8/10.
